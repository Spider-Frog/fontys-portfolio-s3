# Why FastAPI

My most comfortable language to work in is Python. It's quick and easy to develop programs with.

In python you have a lot of choices to choose from when you want to create a Web API.

- Django
- Flask
- Starlette
- FastAPI
- And many more!

## Flask

Flask is the one I have lots of experience with. With Flask, you start with the core features of routing and HTML rendering. Any additional functionality you need, like CORS, Authentication, JWT handling, etc., needs to be downloaded from a separate package.

This makes Flask a very lightweight framework that can easily scale with your requirements.

## FastAPI

FastAPI, on the other hand, has everything you need to create the API of your dreams. It comes with routing, authentication, CORS, automatic documentation, and type hints, all out of the box.

The framework is also relatively new and supports modern Python features like type hints with Pydantic and Async/Await support.

## Why the switch?

I was very comfortable with Flask and its ecosystem but wanted to learn the more modern features of Python, and Flask just wasn't up to the task.

So, I decided to develop this project in FastAPI, and retrospectively, I'm very glad that I did. FastAPI truly lives up to its name. I have never developed as fast as I have with FastAPI.

FastAPI's comprehensive functionality, support for modern Python features, and its ability to accelerate development made it an excellent choice for my project.
