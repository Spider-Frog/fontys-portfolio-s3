## Individual project

During the development of my individual project, I gained valuable insights into organizing and writing user stories. Initially, I struggled with disorganization and inadequate documentation of user stories and issues. However, I have made significant improvements in this aspect. Now, I maintain a systematic approach to tracking the user stories and issues I'm working on.

Previously, I had multiple issues listed under the progress tab of my project, which was highly unlikely as it's uncommon to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. I have rectified this by properly ordering my issues and ensuring that only one user story is placed in the "to-do" tab, along with one or two related issues.

To ensure the quality of my project, I have implemented thorough testing, including unit tests, as well as incorporating feedback from my peers. Additionally, I have documented the entire project on my GitHub page to provide comprehensive information about its development process.

## Group project

Maintaining professionalism within a group project is paramount. In order to work efficiently and effectively, it is crucial to establish clear and precise communication with fellow group members and stakeholders.

Throughout the group project, we diligently track all tasks and issues using the Jira board. Each item is organized under user stories, providing a clear focus for our collective efforts.

During the sprint reviews, we engage in meaningful discussions with stakeholders, seeking their feedback and input to identify areas of improvement and prioritization. Subsequently, we hold group discussions to share our individual perspectives on what we liked, learnt, lacked, and longed for during the sprint.
