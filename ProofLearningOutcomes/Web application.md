# Web application
*You design and build **user-friendly, full-stack** web applications.*

## User friendly
*You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques*

During the development of my web application, I regularly used feedback from my classmates and teacher to ensure that my app is well-refined.

## Full-stack
*You design and build a full-stack application using a commonly accepted front-end JavaScript framework and a back-end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM, and addressing asynchronous communication issues.*

For my individual project, I created a full stack web application.

### Front end
The front end is built with Vue 3 + TypeScript. I chose Vue because I'm very comfortable with the framework. I have 2 years of experience with it already, and I can easily and reliably build a fully functioning front-end application. The entire front end is also written in TypeScript for easy syntax highlighting and type safety inside my code.

### Back end
The back end is made with the FastAPI framework written in Python 3. Over the years, I have built up a lot of experience with the Flask framework. It's lightweight and super flexible for lots of different use cases. However, for this project, I decided to switch to the new and upcoming FastAPI. FastAPI is specially made for APIs (it's in the name, duh!) and uses the latest and greatest features of modern Python 3, such as type hints and data classes. FastAPI also lives up to its name in both development time and runtime speed.
