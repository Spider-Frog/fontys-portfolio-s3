# Cultural differences and ethics
*You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences when working with multi-site teams, and are aware of ethical aspects in software development.*

## Cultural differences

For my individual project, I worked independently, which eliminated the need to consider cultural differences. As a result, I focused solely on my own perspectives and did not encounter any cultural challenges or considerations.

## Ethics

In my project, I adhere to the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) (ACM) code of ethics, which serves as a guiding principle for my work.

First, I prioritize that my code does not cause harm or discriminate against any individuals or groups. I am committed to developing inclusive and unbiased software that respects the rights and dignity of all users.

Moreover, I highly value the privacy of my users. To protect their privacy, my project does not require authentication for usage. Additionally, I do not utilize any cookies for functional or tracking purposes, thereby minimizing the collection of user data.

By following these ethical guidelines, I strive to create a responsible and user-centric project that upholds the principles of fairness, privacy, and non-discrimination.
