# Requirements and desgin
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using **multiple types of test techniques.***

## Individual project

### designs

For my indivudiual project, I decided to stick with a very simple layout for my application.
With not much styling applied to it. The reason for this is that this ensures it's easy to use,
And ensures it's mobile friendly.

*Current look & feel of the application*

During development I have gotten feedback on my designs multiple times.
And have made minor changes in accordance with the feedback to ensure the layout is user-friendly.

### Architecture

The architecture of my app consist of 2 APIs, the Product API for providing the Front end with the data.
And the Scraper service, that scrapes the grocery markerts sites.
