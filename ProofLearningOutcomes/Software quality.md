# Software quality
*You design and build **user-friendly, full-stack** web applications.*

## User friendly
*You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques*

## Full-stack
*You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant commucation protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communcation issues.*

For my individual project, I created a full stack web application.

### Front end
The front end is built with Vue 3 + Typescript. I chose Vue because I'm very comfertable with the framework.
I have 2 years of experience with it already and I can easily & relaibly build a fully funcioning front end application.
The entire front end is also written in Typescript. For easy syntax highlighting and type safety inside my code.

### Back end
The Back end is made with FastAPI framework written in Python 3.
During the years I have build up a lot of experience with Flask framework.
It's lightweight and super flexible for lots of different use cases.
But for this project, I decided to switch to the new & upcoming FastAPI.
FastAPI is specially made for APIs (it's in the name duh!).
And uses the latest and greatest features of modern Python 3 such as type hints, and dataclasses.
FastAPI also lives up to it's name in both development time & runtime speed.
