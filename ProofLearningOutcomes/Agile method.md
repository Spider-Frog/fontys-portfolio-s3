# Agile
*You **choose** and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.*

Agile is a flexible and collaborative approach to project management that emphasizes adaptability, iterative development, and continuous improvement. Throughout my project, I incorporated various agile practices to enhance project organization and personal growth.

## Github project

To effectively organize my agile board, I utilized GitHub Projects. I documented all the user stories and issues that needed to be addressed in the project. Each user story was associated with the relevant sprint, and I ensured to define the Definition of Done and acceptance criteria for each user story.

## Retrospective

During the group project, we conducted retrospectives using the 4 Ls method. This involved discussing what we liked, what we learned, what we lacked, and what we longed for in each sprint. These retrospectives provided valuable insights into the successes and challenges of the sprint, allowing for continuous improvement and adjustment of our approach.

Here are our retrospectives for sprint 2:

One notable observation was the high level of comfort and rapport among the group members. This positive dynamic fostered a productive and collaborative environment, allowing us to work together seamlessly. Fortunately, we did not encounter any significant internal conflicts or issues that could hinder our progress or impact team morale.

## User stories

At the beginning of the project, I created user stories based on the desired features of my application. These user stories served as a guide for the development process and helped prioritize tasks effectively.

Here is an example of a user story:

## Personal growth

Throughout my individual project, I experienced personal growth in terms of project management and organization. Initially, I struggled with maintaining a well-structured scrum board due to my disorganized nature. However, I actively sought feedback from my peers and incorporated their suggestions to improve my approach.

I transitioned from having multiple items in the "progress" status to focusing on one issue and one user story at a time. This change aligns with the understanding that individuals are more productive and efficient when they focus on one task at a time.

While I acknowledge that I still have room for improvement in organizing myself and implementing agile/scrum methodologies, I am confident that this semester has laid the foundation for my growth in these areas. I am committed to continuing my journey of self-improvement and enhancing my skills in project management and agile practices.
